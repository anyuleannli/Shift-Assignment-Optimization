# Shift-Assignment-Optimization

This is to optimize scheduling shifts for all 50 nurses at the emergency department.

The shifts would need to consider some constraints (eg. no nurse may be sched- uled to consecutive shifts) and nurse preferences.

Detailed constraints is shown in LaTex format on Python notebook.
